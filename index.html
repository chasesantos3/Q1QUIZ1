		<p>The plot of Hotel Transylvania 3 is pretty simple. Dracula is feeling lonely and wishes he could have a date. The problem is monsters are only known to “zing” or fall in love with one person in their lives. Drac has already loved Mavis’ Mother so a new love is impossible. Mavis see’s her Dad is unhappy and decides to take the whole group from the hotel on a special monsters cruise she see’s advertised. While on the cruise all kinds of shenanigans happen but the main message of the franchise remains strong- love those who are different and don’t be afraid of those differences. It’s our differences that make us special and make the world great.  This is a very timely and sweet message to share.</p>
